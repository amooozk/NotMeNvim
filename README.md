[This is LazyVim itself...]

[Justification for name change]
  Since I didn't know how to do it from the outside, I thought I would need to make some changes to the internal configuration.
  To ensure that the new LazyVim commits don't ruin everything, I created a new repository and changed the name.

[Configured for]
  Linux
  C++
  to be compiled by clang++
  to be debugged by lldb
